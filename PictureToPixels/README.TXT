PROJECT TITLE: PixelToPicture

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The increasing resolution of images has strongly encouraged facial recognition algorithms.
This allows your avatar to be a representation of yourself without needing to give up your privacy. Alternatively it's
just a neat little project that could be used to create assets or retro looking images from something real.

VERSION or DATE: 10/03/20

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: For now you need to download the files and manually run it like any program. I will fix this soon.
